# EveShield ‚Äì Bluetooth Mesh Feasibility Study

This document assesses the practicality of using Bluetooth mesh networking (e.g., via Bridgefy or Nearby API) as part of EveShield‚Äôs offline communication layer.

## üîç Bluetooth Mesh Reality Check

| Concern                           | Reality                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bluetooth is often off            | ‚úÖ Most users, especially in EveShield's target market, keep Bluetooth disabled. |
| Requires app running nearby       | ‚úÖ Other users must have the app open or in background.                          |
| Mesh needs density                | ‚úÖ Works best with large, active, and local user base.                           |
| Battery optimizations can kill it | ‚úÖ Android may terminate background services unless explicitly whitelisted.      |
| Range limitations                 | ‚úÖ Bluetooth typically covers only 10‚Äì30 meters.                                 |

## üîÑ How Mesh Messaging Works (Bridgefy-style)

Mesh relies on relays:

```
[User A] --BT--> [User B] --BT--> [User C with internet]
```

If no relays exist (no nearby users with Bluetooth + EveShield), the message fails.

## ‚úÖ Feasibility Summary

| Criterion                          | Bluetooth Mesh (P2P)              |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Works without internet             | ‚úÖ                                |
| Works without cell network         | ‚úÖ                                |
| Works if Bluetooth is off          | ‚ùå                                |
| Works if no nearby users exist     | ‚ùå                                |
| Needs large user base to be useful | ‚úÖ (but problematic at MVP stage) |

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- **Use Bluetooth as a fallback**, not the main channel.
- **Educate users** to keep Bluetooth on, similar to COVID apps.
- **Primary delivery** should be:
  - USSD (feature phones)
  - SMS or internet (Android)
  - GPS (when available)

---

## ‚ùå Not Recommended: Central Bluetooth Broadcasting

- Bluetooth has short range (10‚Äì30m)
- Central broadcasting would require BLE towers or mesh nodes
- Not scalable or cost-effective for MVP

---

## üß† Final Word

Bluetooth mesh is **not reliable enough** for life-critical alerts in EveShield‚Äôs MVP stage. It should be seen as an **auxiliary feature**, not a core delivery method.

Focus on **USSD, SMS, and GPS**, and revisit mesh networking only if your active user base becomes large and dense.
