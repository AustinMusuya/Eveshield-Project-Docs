## üî∑ Shared Features (USSD + Android App)

### 1. **SOS Alert Trigger**

Enables users to send an emergency alert discreetly. This is the core lifesaving feature of EveShield and can be activated via USSD input or panic button in the app. It prioritizes minimal user input and speed of execution.

### 2. **Support Information Access**

Provides localized crisis support info such as emergency numbers, safehouses, legal aid contacts, and general safety tips. This empowers users to make informed decisions before, during, or after a crisis.

## üî∂ USSD-Specific Features

### 3. **USSD Menu Navigation**

Users can navigate a series of simple text-based menu options on feature phones to trigger SOS alerts or access support resources. The menu is designed to be minimal, clear, and time-efficient under stress.

### 4. **Camouflaged Entry Point**

The USSD code and menu may be disguised (e.g., appearing as a utility check) to prevent potential abusers from recognizing its true purpose. This ensures safety even in monitored environments.

### 5. **Session Logging**

Each USSD interaction is logged anonymously to track feature usage, system load, and identify common user flows. This data supports future improvements and debugging without compromising user safety.

## üî∑ App-Specific Features

### 6. **Offline Panic Button**

An always-available panic button in the app lets users trigger SOS alerts without needing internet access. The alert is stored locally and sent automatically when connectivity returns or shared via Bluetooth mesh.

### 7. **Bluetooth-Based Alert Relay**

Uses Bluetooth mesh networking (e.g., Bridgefy or Google Nearby API) to relay SOS messages peer-to-peer. This ensures alerts can propagate even when no mobile data or airtime is available, especially in rural or crowded offline environments.

### 8. **Local Resource Caching**

All support resources are stored on-device, allowing users to access life-saving information even without internet access. This feature enhances usability in low-signal areas.

### 9. **Alert Retry Queue**

Alerts that fail to send (due to no network or peers) are automatically retried in the background using WorkManager. This ensures that critical messages are eventually delivered once a valid channel is detected.

### 10. **Discreet App Design**

The app is designed with visual discretion in mind‚Äîneutral naming, generic icon, and customizable UI‚Äîensuring that it does not attract unwanted attention from bystanders or potential threats.

## üìù Notes

- Features are designed around user safety first: minimal taps, low visibility, no unnecessary prompts.
- USSD features favor accessibility, while app features favor capability and future extensibility.
- Both versions are built to complement each other and serve different user groups.
