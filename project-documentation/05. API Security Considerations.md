# EveShield MVP ‚Äì API Security Considerations

This document outlines the importance of backend API security in the EveShield system and details the security measures that will be implemented to protect user interactions and sensitive data.

## üîê Why API Security Matters

Although feature phones don‚Äôt interact with APIs directly, the USSD platform (e.g., Africa‚Äôs Talking) communicates with our backend via APIs. Likewise, the Android app will send and receive sensitive data through secure APIs when online.

**Key reasons API security is essential:**

- **Protect user data:** Phone numbers, location data, and SOS activity must remain private and encrypted.
- **Prevent abuse:** Rate limiting and validation protect the system from spam or malicious access.
- **Ensure trust:** Survivors need confidence that their alerts are safe, private, and can‚Äôt be intercepted or tampered with.
- **Comply with regulations:** Ensures alignment with data protection laws (e.g., Kenya Data Protection Act).

## üì± Feature Phone Integration: How APIs Fit In

Feature phones **do not call APIs directly**. Instead, they interact with USSD menus via telecom gateways. Here's the communication flow:

```
Feature Phone ‚Üí USSD Menu
USSD Menu ‚Üí Telecom Gateway (e.g., Africa‚Äôs Talking)
Telecom Gateway ‚Üí EveShield Backend API
```

The backend handles logic (e.g., triggering alerts, retrieving support info) and responds with menu content, which the telecom platform relays back to the user.

**So yes, APIs support feature phone workflows ‚Äî but indirectly, via telecom layers.**  
This means API security is still crucial to protect data and ensure the flow remains reliable and tamper-proof.

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Security Measures

| Measure                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication**                  | All API endpoints will require authentication. For third-party systems like Africa‚Äôs Talking, this may include secure tokens or IP whitelisting. For the Android app (if needed), JWT tokens can be used for user verification. |
| **Authorization**                   | Ensures only permitted systems or users can access specific endpoints (e.g., admin dashboard, alert log access). Role-based access controls (RBAC) will be implemented for future dashboard expansion.                          |
| **Rate Limiting**                   | API endpoints will be protected by rate limits to prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, or accidental overloads. Especially critical for public-facing endpoints (like SOS submission).                                           |
| **Input Validation & Sanitization** | All API inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks or malformed data from crashing the system.                                                                                                         |
| **HTTPS Only**                      | All communications will occur over encrypted HTTPS connections to protect data in transit. No API should accept HTTP traffic.                                                                                                   |
| **Audit Logging**                   | Key system actions (e.g., SOS submissions, resource changes) will be logged securely for traceability and debugging.                                                                                                            |

## ‚úÖ Summary

Every interaction, whether from a smartphone or a feature phone through a USSD gateway, touches the EveShield backend in some way. Securing that layer ensures:

- Survivor safety
- Data integrity
- System stability
- Compliance with legal standards

API security isn't optional ‚Äî it's foundational.
