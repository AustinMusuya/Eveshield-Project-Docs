# EveShield MVP – Project Overview

## Purpose

EveShield is a personal safety system designed to help individuals, particularly women in vulnerable situations, send discreet SOS alerts, access critical support information, and optionally share their location – even in offline or low-signal environments.

This MVP explores two parallel technological solutions to maximize reach and impact:

---

## 1. USSD-Based MVP (for Feature Phones)

This version targets basic mobile phone users (no internet or apps) and focuses on:

- Enabling instant SOS alerts via a USSD shortcode
- Delivering pre-programmed support/help content
- Ensuring a discreet and fast user experience under stress
- Partnering with telecom aggregators (e.g. Africa’s Talking)

---

## 2. Offline Android App MVP

This version targets smartphone users in areas with limited connectivity. It focuses on:

- Triggering SOS alerts offline via Bluetooth mesh
- Storing user info and sending alerts when internet/SMS becomes available
- Offering a panic button and discreet app design
- Peer-to-peer messaging using Bluetooth technologies (Nearby API, Bridgefy)

---

## MVP Vision

By building both solutions in parallel, EveShield ensures wide accessibility and future scalability — supporting users across urban, rural, online, and offline settings.
