# EveShield MVP ‚Äì Project Requirements

## üìö Introduction to Project Requirements

EveShield is a personal safety system designed for use in crisis situations, enabling users to discreetly send SOS alerts and access critical support resources ‚Äî even in low-connectivity or offline environments. This concept page outlines the **backend requirements** for the EveShield MVP, with support for both a **USSD interface** (for feature phones) and an **offline-capable Android app**.

The requirements below are categorized into **Core Functionalities**, **Technical Requirements**, and **Non-Functional Requirements**, aligning with the unique goals of the project: accessibility, discretion, and reliability.

---

## üîë Core Functionalities

The EveShield backend must support a crisis-response system with flexible delivery modes, ensuring all users (regardless of device type) can access lifesaving tools.

---

### 1. **User Management**

- **User Identification:**
  - Register or identify users using a mobile phone number (for USSD) or a device ID (for the app).
  - Assign device type (`feature_phone`, `smartphone`) at first interaction.
- **Anonymous Interaction (Optional):**
  - Allow minimal user tracking to prioritize safety (e.g., no forced login in app).
- **User Metadata Storage:**
  - Store last known device, location (if available), and interaction history.

---

### 2. **SOS Alert Handling**

- **SOS Trigger (USSD & App):**
  - Accept SOS triggers from USSD sessions and app submissions.
  - Validate, log, and tag alerts as `pending`, `delivered`, or `offline`.
- **Alert Queueing (App only):**
  - Support offline storage and retry of alerts.
- **Bluetooth Relay (App only):**
  - Log relay events for offline peer-to-peer messaging.

---

### 3. **Support Resource Delivery**

**Purpose** - This feature is meant to give survivors quick access to helpful information and support services during a crisis ‚Äî without needing to talk to anyone, and even without an internet connection (on the app).

- ### Regional Resource Management:

  Think of this as a database of:

      Emergency contacts (police, GBV hotlines, ambulance)

      Shelters or safe houses nearby

      Legal aid or counseling centers

It's organized by location, so if someone in Kisumu triggers the menu or app, they get relevant Kisumu support resources ‚Äî not general national info.

Primary function: Store and serve localized crisis info (e.g., emergency contacts, shelters, legal aid).

- ### Multi-format Access:

Feature Phones (USSD) get the content in short, plain-text menus. For example:

          Call 116 (Child Help Line)

          Nearest Shelter: [name, phone]

Smartphones (Offline App) get a more visual UI with icons, colored text, structured cards, etc., making it easier to understand and browse.

- ### Search by Location or Tag:

The system will let users filter or automatically detect what resources are closest or most relevant.

Tags might include: legal, medical, counseling, shelter, child support.

---

### 4. **Session Management (USSD only)**

**Purpose** - Since USSD menus are text-based, time-limited, and hierarchical (multi-step), users can get confused, lost, or time out if the flow is too long or unclear.

This feature helps you record and analyze how real users navigate your menu ‚Äî so you can make it better.

- ### Track USSD Sessions:

  - Record each session path and duration.

    Every time a user starts a USSD session (by dialing your code), record:

    Start and end time (to measure how long they took)

    Each menu step they went through (e.g., 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí End)

    Whether they completed the flow or dropped off

    Phone number or device ID (if available) ‚Äî anonymized or hashed if needed

  This creates a log of user behavior per session.

- ### Menu Flow Analytics:

  - Analyze user behavior to improve UX and flow simplification.

    After logging data, analyze it to understand patterns like:

        Where users frequently drop off

        Which steps are confusing or too slow

        How long typical sessions last

        Which options are used most vs never touched

    Use this insight to:

        Simplify the menu (e.g., reduce steps to send an SOS)

        Reorder items based on popularity

        Disguise or streamline flows to be safer under stress

---

### 5. **Admin Dashboard Support (Future-facing)**

**Purpose** - A web-based control panel used by authorized personnel (admins, responders, system maintainers) to:

    Track what's happening

    Manage support content

    Audit usage and system behavior

- ### Monitor Alert Logs:

  - Primary function: Allow visibility into submitted SOS alerts and relay chains.

    View all SOS alerts submitted ‚Äî by feature phone or smartphone ‚Äî in real time or history.

    See timestamp, phone/device ID, region, and status (e.g., delivered, pending, relayed).

    Useful for:

        Responding to high-risk zones

        Identifying alert patterns (e.g., repeated triggers from one area)

        Following up on false alerts or abuse

- ### Manage Resources:

  - Primary: Enable admin to update crisis resources by region.

    Update or remove local support info (like shelters or legal services) as things change.

    Add new emergency contacts, edit addresses, change tags (e.g., mark one as closed).

    Tag resources by:

        Region (e.g., Nairobi West)

        Type (shelter, legal, health)

    This is crucial for keeping the support content fresh and accurate.

- ### Audit Logs:

  - Primary Function : Log system and API-level interactions for traceability.

    Track what happens inside the system ‚Äî especially changes or security-sensitive events.

    Logs include:

        Admin login attempts

        Edits to support resources

        API access events (e.g., USSD requests, alert pushes)

    Useful for:

        Debugging

        Tracking misuse

        Meeting compliance standards (e.g., if you go for funding or partnerships)

    **_N/B: Why It‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuture-Facing‚Äù_**

  - You won‚Äôt need this fully built into the MVP ‚Äî it‚Äôs not user-facing ‚Äî but you should build the backend in a way that supports it later (i.e., store logs, expose admin-only APIs, design your DB schema with updatable resources).

  It‚Äôs like laying plumbing for a future control room.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

---

### 1. **Database Management**

- Use a document or relational database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
- Required collections/tables:
  - `Users`
  - `SOS_Alerts`
  - `Support_Resources`
  - `USSD_Sessions`
  - `Bluetooth_Relay_Logs`

---

### 2. **API Development**

- Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to:
  - Africa‚Äôs Talking (for USSD)
  - Android app (for alert sync & support resources)
- API methods must use proper HTTP semantics:
  - `POST /sos` ‚Äì Submit an SOS alert
  - `GET /resources` ‚Äì Fetch support information
  - `POST /ussd` ‚Äì Process USSD session payloads

---

### 3. **Authentication and Authorization**

- Use:
  - API keys or IP whitelisting for USSD provider callbacks
  - JWT (optional) for Android app endpoints
  - Role-based access (RBAC) for internal admin users

---

### 4. **API Security**

- Ensure all endpoints are HTTPS-only.
- Validate and sanitize all input data.
- Apply rate limiting on public endpoints.
- Secure stored data (phone numbers, logs) using encryption.
- Maintain audit logs for sensitive actions.

---

### 5. **File Storage (App only)**

- If user-provided data is later required (e.g., recorded evidence), use cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) or local encrypted storage.

---

### 6. **Third-Party Integrations**

- **Africa‚Äôs Talking** ‚Äì USSD gateway for feature phones.
- **Bridgefy / Google Nearby API** ‚Äì Bluetooth P2P communication.
- **SendGrid / Mailgun** ‚Äì Optional for email-based admin notifications.

---

### 7. **Error Handling and Logging**

- Centralized error handling middleware for API.
- Track failed USSD and app submissions for retries and QA.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

---

### 1. **Scalability**

- Design backend to scale horizontally (e.g., containerized services + load balancer).
- Separate concerns: alert processing, resource serving, session logging.

---

### 2. **Security**

- Encrypt sensitive user data.
- Mask phone numbers or use one-way hashing for anonymization.
- Implement firewall and DDoS protections (if public-facing).

---

### 3. **Performance Optimization**

- Use in-memory caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed resources.
- Queue background tasks (e.g., retry alerts, notification dispatch) with tools like Celery or Bull.

---

### 4. **Testing**

- Write unit and integration tests for:
  - API endpoints
  - Alert handling logic
  - Data validation
- Include load testing for expected peak volumes (e.g., simultaneous USSD calls).

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

EveShield's backend must support a dual-mode crisis platform that balances simplicity (USSD) with capability (offline Android app). Security, reliability, and accessibility are non-negotiable. This foundation ensures future expansion into real-time dashboards, geolocation tracking, and cross-platform integration.
